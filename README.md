The Pizza Prog project is a clone of the Dodo Pizza website, implemented using modern technologies such as Next.js, Prisma, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand. This project includes almost all the functionality of the original website for ordering pizza and other dishes. Key features:



Main Page 
Product catalog and filtering - users can select and filter dishes by category (pizza, breakfast, snacks, drinks), as well as sort by popularity and price range. As you can see, the count of items depends on the filters (considering your filters the store has some products and not others).

Yes, this project is not perfect, but Considering that I wrote it in 10 days I think it's pretty good, I think) And yes, it's only in the Russian language, but to understand how it works you don't need to know Russian
